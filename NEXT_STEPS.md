# Next Steps for niveshak-ai Development

## Context Summary

- **Date:** 1 August 2025
- **Current Branch:** feature-company-analysis
- **Main File:** src/analysis/valuation.py
- **Recent Focus:** Security review for hardcoded credentials, DCF and valuation logic, Dockerization, CLI integration, API key management, fallback logic removal.

## Technical Inventory

- **Valuation Module:** DCFAnalyzer, RelativeValuation, RiskAssessment
- **No hardcoded credentials** found in valuation.py
- **Sensitive values** (API keys, tokens) are not present in this file
- **Docker & .env:** .env file is mounted, but ensure all sensitive keys are loaded via environment variables
- **Fallback logic:** Removed from analysis modules; only real data or clear errors are returned
- **Debug Logging:** Added for API key loading in relevant modules

## Outstanding Issues & Next Steps

1. **API Key Substitution**

   - Confirm that all API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) are loaded from environment variables, not config files or hardcoded values
   - Validate .env loading in Docker container
   - Test analysis endpoints to ensure real keys are used and no template strings remain

2. **Security Review**

   - Continue scanning for hardcoded credentials in other files (especially those handling API calls, config, or secrets)
   - Ensure all sensitive values are injected via environment variables

3. **Testing & Validation**

   - Run analysis for real companies (e.g., ASIANPAINT) and confirm output is based on real data
   - Check error handling for missing/invalid keys
   - Validate removal of all fallback/fake data logic

4. **Documentation & Usability**

   - Update README and SETUP_GUIDE to clarify environment variable usage
   - Document how to mount .env in Docker and verify key loading
   - Add debug instructions for troubleshooting API key issues

5. **Code Quality & Refactoring**

   - Review for any remaining legacy fallback logic
   - Refactor modules for clarity and maintainability
   - Add comments where logic is complex or security-relevant

6. **Future Enhancements**
   - Add automated tests for credential loading and error handling
   - Consider using a secrets manager for production deployments
   - Improve logging and monitoring for security events

## How to Resume

- Start by reviewing this document and the latest commit history
- Pick up from the most relevant next step above
- Use debug logs and error messages to guide troubleshooting
- If stuck, revisit Docker and .env setup, and check for hardcoded values in all modules
