- **Recent Logs**: Last 30 days of system logs

### Backup Best Practices

1. **Regular Backups**: Run weekly or after adding new books
2. **Before Updates**: Always backup before system updates
3. **Test Restores**: Periodically verify backup integrity
4. **External Storage**: Copy backups to external drives/cloud
5. **Document Changes**: Note what books/data you've added

### Example Backup Workflow

```bash
# 1. Check current data size
du -sh data/

# 2. Create backup before adding new books
./scripts/backup_data.sh

# 3. Add your new investment books
cp ~/Downloads/new-book.pdf data/books/
python -m src.cli.ingest_books --file "data/books/new-book.pdf"

# 4. Verify everything works
python test_rag.py

# 5. Create another backup with new data
./scripts/backup_data.sh

# 6. List your backups
./scripts/manage_backups.sh list
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. **Ollama Connection Error**

```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
ollama list

# Start Ollama if not running
ollama serve

# Test with a simple query
ollama run deepseek-r1:7b "Hello, test message"
```

#### 2. **Missing Models**

```bash
# Download required models
ollama pull deepseek-r1:7b
ollama pull nomic-embed-text

# Verify models are available
ollama list
```

#### 3. **Qdrant Database Issues**

```bash
# Start Qdrant locally
docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant

# Check if Qdrant is running
curl http://localhost:6333
```

#### 4. **PDF Processing Errors**

```bash
# Install additional dependencies if needed
pip install PyMuPDF

# Test PDF integrity
python -c "
import fitz
doc = fitz.open('data/books/your_book.pdf')
print(f'Pages: {doc.page_count}')
"
```

#### 5. **Memory Issues with Large Models**

- Use smaller models: `ollama pull llama3.2:3b` instead of DeepSeek R1
- Adjust chunk size in `config/settings.yaml`
- Process books one at a time
- Monitor system resources

### Performance Tips

1. **Test Pipeline**: Use `python test_rag.py` to verify everything works
2. **Model Selection**: DeepSeek R1 7B for quality, Llama 3.2 3B for speed
3. **Batch Processing**: Ingest multiple books efficiently
4. **Local Storage**: Keep vector database on SSD for faster search
