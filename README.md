## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. **Vector Database Connection Error**

```bash
# Check if Qdrant is running
./scripts/run_local_vector_db.sh status

# Restart if needed
./scripts/run_local_vector_db.sh restart
```

#### 2. **PDF Processing Errors**

```bash
# Install additional dependencies
pip install PyMuPDF fitz

# Check PDF file integrity
python3 -c "
import fitz
doc = fitz.open('data/books/your_book.pdf')
print(f'Pages: {doc.page_count}')
"
```

#### 3. **OpenAI API Rate Limits**

- Check your API usage in OpenAI dashboard
- Consider using smaller embedding models
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

#### 4. **Memory Issues with Large PDFs**

- Increase chunk size in `config/settings.yaml`
- Process books one at a time
- Use smaller embedding models

### Performance Tips

1. **Optimize Chunk Size**: Adjust based on your content type
2. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple files in batches
3. **Caching**: Enable embedding caching for repeated analysis
4. **Resource Monitoring**: Monitor RAM and disk usage
